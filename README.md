## AUSTENDER OCDS Search API

The Open Contracting Data Standard (OCDS) enables disclosure of data and documents at all stages of the contracting process by defining a common data model. It was created to support organizations to increase contracting transparency, and allow deeper analysis of contracting data by a wide range of users.<sup>[1](#references)</sup>

The Procurement Office of the Department of Finance spearheaded the implementation of OCDS standards for [AUSTender Application] (https://tenders.gov.au), starting with Contract Notices. Other procurement data will follow soon on the next versions.
